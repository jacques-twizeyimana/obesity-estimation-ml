## Why?
This project addresses a critical real-world health problem: obesity classification based on lifestyle factors. Unlike medical datasets that rely on expensive tests or measurements, this dataset uses easily observable behavioral and demographic features such as:
- Eating habits (frequency of high-caloric food consumption, vegetable consumption)
- Physical activity levels
- Transportation methods
- Demographics (age, gender, height, weight)

**Why this problem matters:**
- Obesity is a global health epidemic affecting over 650 million adults worldwide
- Early identification of obesity risk can enable preventive interventions
- The model could be used in public health screening tools or mobile health applications
- Features are easily collectible through surveys, making the model practically deployable

**Target Variable:** Obesity levels classified into 7 categories:
- Insufficient Weight
- Normal Weight  
- Overweight Level I
- Overweight Level II
- Obesity Type I
- Obesity Type II
- Obesity Type III
